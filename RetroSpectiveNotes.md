** SPRINT ONE **

Q. What went well?

Communication with the group was great, we were able to meet and clearly delegate tasks to peoples interests and strengths to efficiently complete tasks for our project.

Q. What didn't go well during this sprint?

Not all group members were assigned partners during this sprint, so they had to reach out when challenges emerged.

Q. What should we change during the next sprint?

During next weeks sprint we should rotate the partners around so that everyone has a chance to work with all of the group members.

Many of us felt that we were not contributing enough and had a strong feeling to contribute more.
